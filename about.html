		<h2>About</h2>
				<p>My name is Jarukrid Niyommalai and I am a graphics designer. My interests developed during my teens from being exposed to beautiful illustrations and various photoshop edits from pictures. From then I started to explore more and eventually became my university major. Having experiences in adobe programs and designing skills, I aim to take the next career step by applying my learnt skills in a working environment and make a contribution towards the growth of a company. I am always looking forward to learning new experiences and taking on new challenges. I am willing to work in teams as well as individual work.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am also a fluent English speaker, scoring 6.5 in IELTS. Learning in an international school since my middle school (late elementary school) I am confident in my English communication skills. I have also voluntarily served the Military for six months as a training for self discipline and endurance. I picked up a bit of HTML basics during my study time as seen int his custom portfolio as well.</p>
